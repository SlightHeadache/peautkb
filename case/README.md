# N.B
When I printed these I mirrored then to do the right hand case.

Unfortunately, I forgot the holes on the right hand pcb aren't exactly in the same place as the left. This meant only the screw at the end of the thumb row lines up.

## TODO design dedicated parts for right hand side with correct holes
